        Urban Axis started in the early 1990s by a group of young people (17-18 years) to promote the Danish skater culture that was in Roskilde. During the 90's it became faster and, for example, they helped arrange the Danish Cup in Skateboarding and BMX.
        <br><br>In 2002, they were honored to be able to hold one of the largest tax rebates in Denmark, where Tony Hawk and Matt Hoffman, among others, came and acted.
        In 2009, they start grieving other target groups to create a more stable income and by using their contacts with the business community in Roskilde, they began to create one-day events spread throughout the year.
        <br><br>Urban Axis is now a well-established company with 3 major events a year and many 1 day events, such as the American Veteran Train down at the port.
        In collaboration with the municipality of Roskilde, they have now created a strong tourist environment with many possibilities.
